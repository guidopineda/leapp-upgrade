It will log a warning whenever backwards-compatible default setting may be required for continuity of service. Based on this logging the system administrator can decide if any backwards-compatible settings need to be made permanent in main.cf or master.cf, before turning off the backwards-compatibility safety net.\nThe backward compatibility safety net is by default turned off in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\nIt can be turned on by running:  \"postconf -e compatibility_level=0\nIt can be turned off by running: \"postconf -e compatibility_level=2\n\nIn the Postfix MySQL database client, the default \"option_group\" value has changed to \"client\", i.e. it now reads options from the [client] group from the MySQL configuration file. To disable it, set \"option_group\" to the empty string.\n\nThe postqueue command no longer forces all message arrival times to be reported in UTC. To get the old behavior, set TZ=UTC in main.cf:import_environment.\n\nPostfix 3.2 enables elliptic curve negotiation. This changes the default smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade setting to \"auto\", and introduces a new parameter \"tls_eecdh_auto_curves\" with the names of curves that may be negotiated.\n\nThe \"master.cf\" chroot default value has changed from \"y\" (yes) to \"n\" (no). This applies to master.cf services where chroot field is not explicitly specified.\n\nThe \"append_dot_mydomain\" default value has changed from \"yes\" to \"no\". You may need changing it to \"yes\" if senders cannot use complete domain names in e-mail addresses.\n\nThe \"relay_domains\" default value has changed from \"$mydestination\" to the empty value. This could result in unexpected \"Relay access denied\" errors or ETRN errors, because now will postfix by default relay only for the localhost.\n\nThe \"mynetworks_style\" default value has changed from \"subnet\" to \"host\". This parameter is used to implement the \"permit_mynetworks\" feature. The change could result in unexpected \"access denied\" errors, because postfix will now by default trust only the local machine, not the remote SMTP clients on the same IP subnetwork.\n\nPostfix now supports dynamically loaded database plugins. Plugins are shipped in individual RPM sub-packages. Correct database plugins have to be installed, otherwise the specific database client will not work. For example for PostgreSQL map to work, the postfix-pgsql RPM package has to be installed.\n",
